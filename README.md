📄 OCR-Based Document Verification System

This project automates the extraction and verification of personal details from official identity documents like PAN and Aadhar cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It matches the extracted data with user-provided application forms to streamline document verification workflows — especially useful in domains like finance, KYC, and digital onboarding.

🔍 Overview
Manual document verification is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This project uses OCR techniques to:

Extract key fields (like Name, DOB, PAN Number, Aadhar Number) from uploaded ID documents.

Automatically match extracted values with those submitted in an application form.

Flag mismatches or missing information in real time.

✅ Supports both PAN cards and Aadhar cards in image format (JPEG/PNG).
